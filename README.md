# Inspirit-AI-Deep-Dive-Designing-DL-Systems-FinalProject-RL-for-Autonomous-Vehicles

The overall aim of this project was to teach a reinforcement learning agent to drive by itself by learning from its surroundings, and using that information to make a decision that will lead to the best reward. Some considerations going into this project were how automation can help ensure personal/environmental safety, prevent motor vehicle accidents, devastation of impaired driving, drugged driving, and unbelted vehicle occupants.

The environment in which we will be training our agent has certain components and they are:
  1. States/observation - The current position of the agent or what the agent sees when it's in the environment
  2. Actions - The possible actions the agent can take in a a given state(traffic light)
  3. Rewards - A measure of how good taking a certain action in a state is
